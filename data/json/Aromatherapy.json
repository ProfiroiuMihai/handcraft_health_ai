      "DETAILED_DESCRIPTION": "<p><strong>Habitat</strong>: The bitter orange tree is a small evergreen that typically reaches a height of 10 feet in cultivation but may reach up to 20 feet when growing in the wild. It has a smooth brown trunk, stout branches and flexible green twigs with rather blunt thorns, and a more erect stature and compact crown than that of the sweet orange tree (Citrus sinensis). The fruits of Citrus aurantium are round or oval measuring 7-8 centimeters across, with a thick, heavily pitted peel that turns from yellow-golden to orange red on maturity. It comprises of 10 to 12 segments with a strongly acid pulp and numerous seeds, and like all citrus fruits the essential oil glands are found in tiny pits located within the peel.</p> <EOL> <EOL><p><strong>Aroma</strong>: Fresh, tart and citrusy. On the emotional system bitter orange essential oil is uplifting and energizing for the body yet calming to the mind and emotions. It is used in Ayurvedic medicine as an aid to meditation, and this is perhaps why it can be extremely helpful in easing stress and anxiety. Diffusing bitter orange oil is said to help dispel irritability and frustration for both adults and children alike!</p> <EOL> <EOL><p><strong>Affinities</strong>: The digestive system; Gently massaging your stomach with 2 drops of bitter orange oil blended with sesame oil can help support the entire process of digestion. You can also add 2 drops of this oil to your bathtub to help with digestive ailments.</p> <EOL> <EOL><p><strong>Folklore</strong>: The bitter variety was the first orange to be introduced to the New World, finding its way to Mexico in 1568 and South America later in 1587. The sweet variety was unknown throughout Europe until it was introduced from India by Portuguese traders, eventually becoming the more popular choice.</p> <EOL> <EOL><p><strong>Words of wisdom:</strong> Bitter Orange Essential Oil is photo-toxic.&nbsp;Do not take any oils internally and do not apply undiluted essential oils or other concentrated essences onto the skin without advanced essential oil knowledge or consultation from a qualified aromatherapy practitioner. Use caution when using oils with children and pets. Consult a qualified aromatherapy practitioner before using oils with children, the elderly, during pregnancy, or if you have medical issues or are taking medications.</p> <EOL> <EOL><p>&ldquo;Bitter Orange Essential Oil.&rdquo; <em>Quinessence</em>, Mar. 2019, www.quinessence.com/blog/bitter-orange-essential-oil</p> <EOL> <EOL><p>Tisserand, Robert, and Tony Balacs.&nbsp;<em>Essential Oil Safety</em>.

It also combines easily and well with other similar oils ... Rosemary, Eucalyptus or Saro, for instance.*</p> <EOL>",

      "DETAILED_DESCRIPTION": "<p>Our liquid soap&hellip;. Wait until you see and try our Organic Liquid Soap Soother. It is unlike any liquid soap you have ever seen. Like all of the Emily products, it is made for people with sensitive skin and for people who are careful about what they put on their skin. It is organic certified, has no color, no fragrance, and is made with gentle, all-natural ingredients.</p> <EOL> <EOL><p>Then it is &ldquo;super-fatted&rdquo;. &lsquo;What does that mean?&rsquo; you ask. Read on and we&rsquo;ll explain...</p> <EOL> <EOL><p>We start with the gentlest organic soap/gel base made of rich, moistening and organic ingredients that will not strip your protective oils or make your skin drier:</p> <EOL> <EOL><ul> <EOL>\t<li>&bull; Saponified Organic Coconut Oil</li> <EOL>\t<li>&bull; Saponified Organic Olive Oil</li> <EOL>\t<li>&bull; Saponified Organic Jojoba Oil</li> <EOL>\t<li>&bull; Organic Guar Gum Extract</li> <EOL>\t<li>&bull; Organic Aloe Vera</li> <EOL>\t<li>&bull; Rosemary Extract</li> <EOL></ul> <EOL> <EOL><p>There is absolutely nothing else in our soap base. NO parabens. NO Sodium Laurel or Laureth Sulfate (SLS). NO added color. NO added fragrances.</p> <EOL> <EOL><p>Then we take more Organic Olive Oil and cook in the following 4 herbs:</p> <EOL> <EOL><ul> <EOL>\t<li>&bull; Rehmannia Root</li> <EOL>\t<li>&bull; Angelica Sinensis Root</li> <EOL>\t<li>&bull; Dandelion Herb</li> <EOL>\t<li>&bull; Field Mint</li> <EOL></ul> <EOL> <EOL><p>This herb-infused oil is then added back to our soap base. In traditional soap making, adding extra oils back into soap is called &ldquo;super-fatting&rdquo;. It makes for an extra moistening, silky and emollient soap. &nbsp;</p> <EOL> <EOL><p>We do not know of any other &lsquo;super-fatted&rsquo; liquid soap available. It simply is more expensive to make and most manufacturers are afraid that customers will be scared off by a product that settles.&nbsp;</p> <EOL> <EOL><p>We are just the opposite. We&rsquo;ve put it in a clear bottle so you can see that &lsquo;super-fatted&rsquo; difference. If you let it sit for a while, those extra oils will settle. As it says on the label, &ldquo;This is a natural product. If it settles, shake it! Shake it! Shake it!&rdquo; &nbsp;</p> <EOL> <EOL><p>We are confident that you have never seen or felt a liquid soap this gentle and soothing.</p> <EOL> <EOL><p>Our Liquid Soap Soother lathers wonderfully but does not strip or dry your skin. Use it from head to toe, for all your soap needs.</p> <EOL> <EOL><p>For people with dry skin conditions, soaps can be a huge factor. Most commercial soaps are TROUBLE. They smell and lather well, but they are full of harsh chemicals and fragrances which open your pores up and strip away your natural, protective oils, leaving you drier. Even soaps that are supposedly for &lsquo;sensitive skin&rsquo; or for &lsquo;infants&rsquo; are often full of harsh chemicals, just in smaller amounts. Emily and I both have sensitive skin and liquid soaps were almost impossible for us. That is why we had to make a healthy alternative.</p> <EOL> <EOL><p>If you have dry or sensitive skin you should use a natural soap with as few ingredients as possible. The more ingredients, the more your skin has to deal with and potentially react to. Read your labels to see how many unpronounceable ingredients are in most soap. Then, try our soap. We think you&rsquo;ll find it leaves your skin clean, soft, and happy. Your skin will thank you.</p> <EOL>",

It&rsquo;s wood was used extensively in construction and furniture making because it is highly resistant to decay, is very dense and comes in attractive colours from olive-brown to reddish-brown.

Our spirit naturally wants to be lighter and transform the burdens we have carried, to live a fuller life.

As we clear the dampness in our senses (vision, hearing, smelling)&nbsp;with these oils, we clear the past and very literally change the perception of our present.

In Chinese medicine the same energy that digests our food (the Spleen and Stomach) also digests the ideas we take in our mind. When this energy gets used a lot we get prone to overthinking and ruminating as well as mental fatigue and sluggishness. Patchouli strongly helps with overthinking and strengthens the ability to retain information. Vetiver is a very grounding oil that helps with our sense of belonging and fear of putting ourself in public view with our knowledge. Vetiver helps us be our own role model by encouraging a healthy egocentricity. Bai yu lan ye (magnolia flower) helps clear our thinking and lifts our spirits, so we don&#39;t take ourselves or the material too seriously.&nbsp;Bai Zhi (angelica root)&nbsp;also brings clarity to the mind, and is an ancient oil said to invoke angelic presence. Geranium aids us in processing our food and calms the shen (emotions) so we can let some of the stress of learning go.

      "SHORT_DESCRIPTION": "<p>Thyme Essential Oil, 1/2 oz</p> <EOL>",
      "DETAILED_DESCRIPTION": "<p>Habitat: Thymus vulgaris is a strongly aromatic perennial plant that grows close to the ground in dense patches, typically reaching no more than 12 inches in height. It has a woody, fibrous root, numerous narrow wiry stems, and small narrow, hairy, green-grey leaves arranged in opposite pairs. The small attractive flowers may be white, pink or purple according to its geographical location, and they grow in dense clusters. Like many other plants of the Lamiaceae family, Thyme was native to the Mediterranean but has now spread throughout the world and is found growing wild or cultivated abundantly in Algeria, China, France, Portugal, Italy, Israel, Morocco, Spain, Russian Federation, Tunisia, Turkey and USA.</p> <EOL> <EOL><p>Aroma: Thyme Essential Oil smells fresh, herbaceous and slightly medicinal. Feeling mentally fatigued? Add Thyme essential oil to your favorite diffuser blend to get your mental wheels spinning. Thyme oil has a stimulating aroma and promotes a sense of alertness.</p> <EOL> <EOL><p>Affinities: The Thyme plant is high in thymol. The powerful combination of chemicals in Thyme Essential Oil provide a cleansing and purifying effect on the skin; however, because of the prominent presence of thymol, Thyme Oil should be diluted with a carrier oil before application. Thymol is a powerful antiseptic and is extensively used to medicate gauze and wool for surgical dressings. It is therefore preferable as a dressing and during recent years has been one of the most extensively used antiseptics.</p> <EOL> <EOL><p>Folklore: Historically, fresh and dried Thyme as well as the essential oil have been used to help ward off bacteria and viruses. The name is derived from the Greek word &#39;thymos&#39; that means vitality, courage, or spirit, and was used as an incense in Greek temples. The Egyptians used it in their embalming process and during the Middle Ages it was given to jousting knights for courage.</p> <EOL> <EOL><p>Words of wisdom: Caution to those who have hypersensitive, diseased or damaged skin, or are under 2 years of age. Do not take any oils internally and do not apply undiluted essential oils or other concentrated essences onto the skin without advanced essential oil knowledge or consultation from a qualified aromatherapy practitioner. Use caution when using oils with children and pets. Consult a qualified aromatherapy practitioner before using oils with children, the elderly, during pregnancy, or if you have medical issues or are taking medications.</p> <EOL> <EOL><p>&ldquo;Thyme Essential Oil Uses and Benefits: AromaWeb.&rdquo;&nbsp;<em>Aromatherapy and Essential Oil Information</em>, <a href=\"http://www.aromaweb.com/essential-oils/thyme-oil.asp\">www.aromaweb.com/essential-oils/thyme-oil.asp</a>.</p> <EOL> <EOL><p>&ldquo;Thyme Essential Oil.&rdquo;&nbsp;<em>Quinessence</em>, 31 May 2019, <a href=\"http://www.quinessence.com/blog/thyme-essential-oil\">www.quinessence.com/blog/thyme-essential-oil</a>.</p> <EOL> <EOL><p>&ldquo;Thyme, Garden.&rdquo;&nbsp;<em>A Modern Herbal | Thyme, Garden</em>, <a href=\"http://www.botanical.com/botanical/mgmh/t/thygar16.html\">www.botanical.com/botanical/mgmh/t/thygar16.html</a>.</p> <EOL> <EOL><p>Tisserand, Robert, and Tony Balacs.&nbsp;<em>Essential Oil Safety</em>.
