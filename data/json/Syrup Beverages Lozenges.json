Polyphenols are natural plant compounds that act as powerful antioxidants and help fight free radicals, which can stress DNA as well as other compounds in the body. Many scientists believe that free radicals contribute to the aging process.

One abundant type of polyphenol in green tea is called catechins. Catechins are known to exhibit potent free radical neutralizing properties. The major catechin in green tea leaves is called EGCG (epigallocatechin gallate) and is considered to be green tea&rsquo;s key active component. It is also valued for its active antioxidant properties.*</p> <EOL> <EOL><p>WHAT ARE THE BENEFITS OF EGCG?<br /> <EOL>EGCG offers many benefits for overall health and well-being.* It has been studied extensively for its benefits in weight maintenance through promotion of fat metabolism.* Thus, it plays an important role in supporting overall health and wellness.* EGCG has also been scientifically shown to assist in maintaining healthy tissues during normal metabolic stress.*<br /> <EOL>In summary, the little superstar component of green tea, EGCG, supports weight management benefits when coupled with a healthy diet and regular exercise routine.* It works to help optimize metabolic wellness and also promotes cardiovascular health due to its abundant supply of antioxidant activity.* Overall, green tea with its superb EGCG content, supports foundational health and wellness.*</p> <EOL> <EOL><p>Welcome to the scientifically studied superstar of the plant kingdom: Green Tea.<br /> <EOL>Now available in a convenient, easy-to-swallow capsule form in scientifically demonstrated concentrations.

What&rsquo;s the difference between green tea and black tea? Although both teas come from the same plant (Camellia sinensis), it is the processing that makes the key difference. Green tea leaves (harvested as young, healthy, dark green leaves) are steamed to prevent them from fermenting, keeping their green color and potent phytochemicals intact. In contrast, black tea is really green tea that has been over-fermented, thus changing the color from green to black, but also destroying the beneficial phytochemicals in the process.</p> <EOL> <EOL><p>Genuine Quality - Where Trust Is Earned</p> <EOL> <EOL><p>We take our green tea seriously!&nbsp; When a fresh lot of bulk green tea arrives, we perform an entire panel of laboratory testing on this raw material which meets and often exceeds the FDA&rsquo;s requirements. Why? Because we believe that ultra-benefits are ONLY possible from ultra-quality.</p> <EOL> <EOL><p>Before the preparation of Green Tea-ND begins, we first authenticate the botanical identity of the green tea (this helps to exclude raw materials that may have been adulterated with the wrong species or other look-alike herbs). Next, we complete an in-depth phytoforensic screening where we inspect for undesirable inorganic materials such as herbicides and pesticides. Our PRL quality guarantee ensures that our green tea meets FDA requirements for identity, purity, strength, composition while testing for contaminates such as heavy metals (including arsenic, mercury, cadmium and lead), residual solvents in extracts and pathogenic microbiology. The raw materials in this product have not been solvent extracted or heat damaged.</p> <EOL> <EOL><p>&nbsp;As you can see, through rigorous manufacturing and quality control standards, PRL strives to deliver a highly consistent quality product that contains quantum quality green tea manufactured without added undesirable agents such as magnesium stearate or talcum powder.</p> <EOL> <EOL><p>Although many manufacturers still use magnesium stearate as a flowing agent, PRL takes a solid stand against its use. We believe magnesium stearate has NO place in nutritional supplements and is best avoided. Ingesting magnesium stearate may partially metabolize into formaldehyde which is listed as a carcinogen by the U.S. Dept. of Health and Human Services.</p> <EOL> <EOL><p>Welcome to the centuries-old flavor of ultra-quality green tea that delivers a full spectrum of highly desirable support agents such as naturally occurring polyphenols.

It has graduated from the farmer&rsquo;s teapot to common household use as science has shown its wide-reaching effectiveness in many areas of support. Research conducted in the last 20 years has confirmed that green tea, known primarily as a pleasant beverage around the world, contains a long list of very impressive phytonutrients that advocates have been tapping into for centuries.</p> <EOL> <EOL><p>&nbsp;Probiotic-Cultured Delivery System</p> <EOL> <EOL><p>We took green tea up another notch! We fermented it! Green Tea-ND is a revolutionary, highly absorbable delivery system made with our signature probiotic-cultured technology.

Even those with poor digestion can enjoy the full benefits of Green Tea ND&rsquo;s highly bio-available, liquid nutrients. No other form of green tea can offer this type of phytonutrient bioavailability and quality.</p> <EOL> <EOL><p>Green Tea vs. Black Tea</p> <EOL> <EOL><p>Green tea has become famous for its spectacular benefits in comparison with black tea. What&rsquo;s the difference between green tea and black tea? Although both teas come from the same plant (Camellia sinensis), it is the processing that makes the key difference. Green tea leaves (harvested as young, healthy, dark green leaves) are steamed to prevent them from fermenting, keeping their green color and potent phytochemicals intact. In contrast, black tea is really green tea that has been over-fermented, thus changing the color from green to black, but also destroying the beneficial phytochemicals in the process.</p> <EOL> <EOL><p>Genuine Quality - Where Trust Is Earned</p> <EOL> <EOL><p>We take our green tea seriously!&nbsp; When a fresh lot of bulk green tea arrives, we perform an entire panel of laboratory testing on this raw material which meets and often exceeds the FDA&rsquo;s requirements. Why? Because we believe that ultra-benefits are ONLY possible from ultra-quality.</p> <EOL> <EOL><p>Before the preparation of Green Tea-ND begins, we first authenticate the botanical identity of the green tea (this helps to exclude raw materials that may have been adulterated with the wrong species or other look-alike herbs). Next, we complete an in-depth phytoforensic screening where we inspect for undesirable inorganic materials such as herbicides and pesticides. Our PRL quality guarantee ensures that our green tea meets FDA requirements for identity, purity, strength, composition while testing for contaminates such as heavy metals (including arsenic, mercury, cadmium and lead), residual solvents in extracts and pathogenic microbiology. The raw materials in this product have not been solvent extracted or heat damaged.</p> <EOL> <EOL><p>&nbsp;As you can see, through rigorous manufacturing and quality control standards, PRL strives to deliver a highly consistent quality product that contains quantum quality green tea manufactured without added undesirable agents such as magnesium stearate or talcum powder.</p> <EOL> <EOL><p>Although many manufacturers still use magnesium stearate as a flowing agent, PRL takes a solid stand against its use. We believe magnesium stearate has NO place in nutritional supplements and is best avoided. Ingesting magnesium stearate may partially metabolize into formaldehyde which is listed as a carcinogen by the U.S. Dept. of Health and Human Services.</p> <EOL> <EOL><p>Welcome to the centuries-old flavor of ultra-quality green tea that delivers a full spectrum of highly desirable support agents such as naturally occurring polyphenols. For centuries, the amazing benefits of green tea have been revered as one of nature&rsquo;s profound little treasures.</p> <EOL> <EOL><p>For optimal support, you will find that Premeir Research Lab&#39;s Green Tea-ND is one of our top &ldquo;products of choice&rdquo; for you and your family.
