      "DETAILED_DESCRIPTION": "<p>Propolis is a bee-derived product, a waxy substance that holds hive together. it is rich in plant substances, mainly flavanoids that inhibit a wide range of infections, including bacterial, fungal and viral. In China, bee propolis has also been subject to some research and clinical application; for example, it was shown effective for treating an oral viral infection (hairy leukoplakia). Goldenseal and coptis are rich in berberine and related alkaloids (these components conger the golden color to the herbs) that have anti-infection properties, mainly useful for intestinal and respiratory disorders. Goldenseal is widely used in Western countries, though it is now known in China and incorporated into Chinese pharmacy (it is known as North American coptis, beimei huanglian). Coptis is frequently used in Chinese formulas to inhibit bacterial infections. Propol-Gold thus brings together flavanoid and alkaloid anti-infection agents that can be used as natural antibiotics; they may be employed along with pharmaceutical antibiotics to broaden the range of action and treat stubborn infections. This formula can be added in small amounts, 1 or 2 tablets per day, along with complex herb formulas used for infection, such as Isatis 6, Stemona Tablets, or Picrorrhiza 11.</p> <EOL>",

      "DETAILED_DESCRIPTION": "<p>Tang Royal Jelly is the finest fresh royal jelly product available - 1000 mg of fortified fresh royal jelly in each capsule. Tang Royal Jelly contains only fresh royal jelly, not freeze dried. Though freeze dried royal jelly is substantially cheaper to produce, scientific evidence shows that the freeze frying process (also known as lyophlization) causes changes in the molecular structure of royal jelly&#39;s components causing it to be less effective. Tang Royal Jelly is the only fortified fresh royal jelly capsule. In nature, royal jelly contains up to 66% water. For Tang Royal Jelly, a portion of this jelly is carefully removed through a complex process without damaging its components. This process called fortification makes the contents of each Tang Royal Jelly capsule more potent and more effective. Tang Royal Jelly comes in a convenient one-a-day capsule. Tang Royal Jelly capsules are hermetically sealed and contain wheat germ oil (known for its superior antioxidant and preservative effects) for freshness, stability and strength. Tang Royal Jelly is harvested through advanced techniques, without cruelty, from the hives of the world&#39;s finest bees found on the renowned, pesticide-free Frangrance Mountain in China. Tang Royal Jelly capsules are manufactured for maximum purity and effectiveness by England&#39;s leading herbal nutritional supplement laboratory known for its state-of-the-art, innovative processing techniques. Tang Royal Jelly is Europe&#39;s leading royal jelly - setting the standard for excellence and quality.</p> <EOL>",

This pollen enables flowering plants to reproduce. Amazingly, the tiny grains of pollen contain all the substances that are necessary to create new life in the plant world. Like little sparks of life energy, how pollen works to create new life is still a mystery to us.&nbsp; In fact, some of the greatest benefits derived from flower pollen extract may stem from natural elements that are still unknown to science.</p> <EOL> <EOL><p>Some people call pollen the ultimate super nutrient. Pollen naturally contains a vast, life-giving array of nutrients, vitamins, amino acids, enzymes and other phytonutrients.&nbsp; Flower pollen extracts were first developed in Sweden and have been specifically used for more than 30 years in Europe and Asia to promote general vitality and wellness as well as prostate support.&nbsp; Numerous studies have proven that flower pollen is an effective tool to maintain and promote prostate and urinary tract health.*</p> <EOL> <EOL><p>Why Use Flower Pollen? Enjoy the amazing benefits of one of nature&rsquo;s most revered treasures: Flower Pollen Extract.&nbsp; Whether you want to experience a high quality of overall health and wellness or specifically benefit from its value in promoting prostate and urinary tract health, you&rsquo;ll find that Premier Research Labs UltraPollen&trade; is one of Nature&rsquo;s top &ldquo;products of choice&rdquo; for you and your family.*</p> <EOL> <EOL><p>For centuries, pollen has been revered as an outstanding health support agent. UltraPollen&trade;has been specially formulated according to the scientific discoveries found in clinical research that was conducted on the benefits of flower pollen extract to support prostate and urinary tract function.* UltraPollen&trade; offers a superior form of flower pollen extract, providing a 20:1 concentrate to ensure optimum potency of its nutritional constituents.&nbsp; Flower pollen extract naturally contains both water-soluble (hydrophilic) and fat-soluble (lipophilic) fractions. This premier quality flower pollen extract also has low allergen risk (mold and spore have been cleaned). It is collected from plants that are grown and harvested without pesticides.</p> <EOL> <EOL><p>Flower pollen delivers a full spectrum of naturally occurring nutrients, custom-designed by nature, that are needed by the body to maintain good health.* Although we do not individually test for these components, flower pollen is a natural source for each of the 10 essential amino acids, non-essential amino acids, antioxidants and enzymes as well as important phytosterols.</p> <EOL> <EOL><p>Breakthrough Manufacturing The preparation of this premier rye pollen extract begins early each year by selecting a certified premium quality seed, using no herbicides or pesticides, and the appropriate amount of acreage to grow it. At the optimal time for each pollen type, the pollen is then harvested with patented, custom-designed equipment.&nbsp; It then moves through a proprietary process consisting of a tightly controlled series of steps that separates the pollen from the plant material. Yearly differences in the properties of the pollen, such as moisture and pollen density, require minute adjustments in the processing to achieve optimal standardization.</p> <EOL> <EOL><p>Committed to Quality, Consistency and Safety Our commitment to safety for both our customers and the environment has led us to deliver the only non-solvent extracted flower pollen using environmentally-friendly CO2 and H2O extraction methods. Through rigorous manufacturing and quality control standards, PRL strives to deliver a highly consistent quality product that contains premier quality pollen, has low allergen risk, is gluten-free and is manufactured without added undesirable excipients such as magnesium stearate or talcum powder.</p> <EOL>",
