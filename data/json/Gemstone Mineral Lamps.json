It is thought to release feelings of closeness in the chest and promotes absorption of fresh air. Amethyst also helps regulate fluids in the upper airway passages.&nbsp; Amethyst kicks in during the middle of the night to&nbsp;support the lungs and open airways in the early mornings (Lung time 3a-5a) just before dawn. Working with open airways they encourage rhythmic breathing allowing inner peace and good rest. Later in the morning (5a-7a) Amethyst encourages proper elimination through the large intestine which helps rid the body of pathogens and toxins. This is a bonus, Amethyst relieves the skin of its duties of elimination leaving the skin refreshed and healthy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div> <EOL> <EOL><div>&nbsp;</div> <EOL> <EOL><div>We<strong>&nbsp;</strong>combined Amethyst with&nbsp;<strong>Amber&nbsp;</strong>to strengthen the soul of the lungs. It has been thought to help asthmatics and calm the&nbsp;<em>Shen.&nbsp;</em>Amber fortifies mucous membranes and kidneys.&nbsp;It&nbsp;treats the liver, kidneys and lungs with care while the body rests. Amber is known to enliven every cell in the body with spirit and energy.

The object is placed in a chemical bath as a cathode (positive) with a copper wire as an anode (negative). Through the process of electrolysis, an electrical current is run through the copper wire, causing the copper ions to displace in the solution and &ldquo;stick&rdquo; to the object which has been immersed. This builds layers upon layers of copper plating until the metal reaches the desired thickness, so the plating process takes several hours.</p> <EOL>",

Users of crystals for their healing energies will learn how their tools become impure and corrupted as well as how to adequately purify them from foreign energies and information. The instructions are demonstrated through a complete cleansing ceremony that can be used on all crystals, including jewelry. Other topics covered include the external cleaning of jewelry for purely aesthetic purposes and the correct application of crystals for cleansing rooms.</p> <EOL> <EOL><div class=\"a-section a-spacing-small a-padding-base\"> <EOL><h3>About the Author</h3> <EOL> <EOL><div class=\"a-section a-spacing-small a-padding-small\">Michael Gienger (1964-2014) was one of Europe&rsquo;s most respected experts on crystals and their uses, a field in which he had been active since 1988. He started collecting minerals in 1972, and in 1985 a successful self-treatment with healing crystals inspired him to pursue further training as an alternative healing practitioner. He was trained in shiatsu and completed a two-year apprentice in shamanic healing. He went on to author more than 20 publications, a number of which have become standard works in their field and have been translated into 11 languages.</div> <EOL> <EOL><div class=\"a-section a-spacing-small a-padding-small\">&nbsp;</div> <EOL> <EOL><div class=\"a-section a-spacing-small a-padding-small\">Publisher : Earthdancer Books; 1st edition (September 1, 2008)<br /> <EOL>ISBN-10 : 1844091473<br /> <EOL>ISBN-13 : 978-1844091478</div> <EOL></div> <EOL> <EOL><p>&nbsp;</p> <EOL>",
