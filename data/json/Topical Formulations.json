It contains herbs rich in purple polyphenols because purples are an excellent nutrient and we love the color of amethyst! Spagyric Oil of amethyst is an alchemical extract that yields a skin soothing oil. It is made with real wild harvested amethyst. Even though amethyst crystal does not contain oil, the minerals in the crystal are used to catalyse an oil using natural spagyric alchemical methods. It is a very special extract and a fascinating chemistry. The resulting oil of amethyst also contains the energetic imprint of the crystal amethyst. The spagyric oil of amethyst that we use is made by a colleague and spagyric mentor at Secret Fire Apothecary, with a cluster of Amethyst from Nova Scotia&rsquo;s Amethyst Cove, in Canada. Another thing we love about this special spagyric crystal oil is that it does not require constant harvesting of crystals and the original crystal can be used to catalyse the oil for many years.&nbsp;</p> <EOL> <EOL><p><strong><em>Facial at home skincare steps.

It contains herbs rich in purple polyphenols because purples are an excellent nutrient and we love the color of amethyst! Spagyric Oil of amethyst is an alchemical extract that yields a skin soothing oil. It is made with real wild harvested amethyst. Even though amethyst crystal does not contain oil, the minerals in the crystal are used to catalyse an oil using natural spagyric alchemical methods. It is a very special extract and a fascinating chemistry. The resulting oil of amethyst also contains the energetic imprint of the crystal amethyst. The spagyric oil of amethyst that we use is made by a colleague and spagyric mentor at Secret Fire Apothecary, with a cluster of Amethyst from Nova Scotia&rsquo;s Amethyst Cove, in Canada. Another thing we love about this special spagyric crystal oil is that it does not require constant harvesting of crystals and the original crystal can be used to catalyse the oil for many years.&nbsp;</p> <EOL> <EOL><p><strong><em>Facial at home skincare steps.

      "DETAILED_DESCRIPTION": "<p>ArthroGenx cream will give an immediate sense of warmth and help ease pain, but unlike most topical products it doesn&#39;t stop with just analgesic benefits. ArthroGenx cream has key nutrients that assist in reducing inflammatory mediators, feed cell membranes with essential fatty acids, and support connective tissue repair and proper joint lubrication and flexibility. This is a cream designed to support actual repair?not just for temporary symptomatic benefit.* After an injury initially use RICE (Rest, Ice, Compress, and Elevate). ArthroGenx cream is excellent during this stage of treatment. After the initial swelling dissipates continue to use ArthroGenx cream and consider discontinuing the ice treatment and moving toward gentle heat. Low-level heat will enhance circulation to the injured area and promote a more rapid resolution of the symptoms. High heat is not recommended as it could cause further injury to already damaged cells. Orally, PainX is also excellent to work systemically to resolve inflammation and promote a more rapid response to treatment.* About ArthroGenx Cream ? * Transdermal pain relief cream* * Joint pain relief* * Reduce inflammation* * Improve joint mobility* * Based on breakthrough technology called SimBioDAS. This technology assures the quality and concentration of ingredients.* * Relieves bruises* * Relieves pain from burns* Joint pain and stiffness needs to be relieved from internally as well as topically. As internal treatments take some time to relieve pain, Arthroxin is a welcome natural product. However, one must also focus on the cause of the arthritic pains and stiffness. Consult your physician and try to capture the cause. Some causes of joint pains and aches are food allergies, hypothyroidism, poor dietary intake, lack of fluids, autoimmune disease, digestive problems, psoriasis and overuse.*</p> <EOL>",

For each case it is best to consult a post partum steam trained practitioner as it depends on diagnosis).&nbsp;</li> <EOL>\t<li>After ovulation while trying to conceive. (Steaming has been used to develop egg quality in advance as part of fertility preparation).&nbsp;</li> <EOL></ul> <EOL> <EOL><p><strong>NOTES&nbsp; on Contraindications:</strong></p> <EOL> <EOL><p>The contraindication for infection is about the presence of a) fever or b) open wounds which will get worse with damp and steam.&nbsp;</p> <EOL> <EOL><ol> <EOL>\t<li>A) FEVER: If someone has a fever due to an infection, (gyne infection or otherwise) steaming is contraindicated, but you will often see hot baths or showers recommended for certain types of fever but not for others. With diagnosis, a practitioner can look at what the nature of the cause of the fever is and if warmth and steam will help to resolve it and release the exterior, or if it will exacerbate heat and fever.&nbsp; If you are unsure, or if the fever is going to get worse from a steam, then you can&nbsp; consider if using the herbal decoction as a douche would be appropriate. You may also decide to wait until the fever has resolved. The applicator syringe is 60ml with a catheter tip which is great for douche insertion and you can use less water than you would to create the douche decoction as for a steam decoction. Amounts and temperature guides are given in the instructions.</li> <EOL>\t<li>B) OPEN WOUNDS: If someone has any open skin wounds that can get infected from the toes up to the waist then steaming can be a risk because you wrap the whole lower body in a sheet or blanket to keep the steam inside. Things like leg ulcers would be a direct risk with steaming. Again you can decide if a body temperature or slightly warmer douche might be appropriate. If there are open wounds on the upper half of the body that are not infected or ulcerated they will often be ok, as long as the steam blanket is wrapped from the toes to the waist.&nbsp;</li> <EOL></ol> <EOL> <EOL><p><strong>OPTIONS FOR EACH KIT &ndash;</strong> detailed instructions come with each kit.</p> <EOL> <EOL><p>Steam: 1 cup decocted and steamed as warm as is comfortable to sit in for 20 minutes wrapped in a blanket.&nbsp;</p> <EOL> <EOL><p>Douche: &frac12;&nbsp; cup decocted (or use the decoction from a steam session) and applied at body temperature or a bit warmer for cold gyne patterns. 97 &ndash; 102F / 36- 39C</p> <EOL> <EOL><p>Enema: &frac12;&nbsp; cup decocted and applied at body temperature or a bit warmer for cold large intestine patterns. 97 &ndash; 102F / 36- 39C.</p> <EOL> <EOL><p>Male genital soak: &frac12;&nbsp; cup decocted and cooled to below body temperature, around room temperature 75-85F&nbsp; or 23C -30C then used as a soak.

For each case it is best to consult a post partum steam trained practitioner as it depends on diagnosis).&nbsp;</li> <EOL>\t<li>After ovulation while trying to conceive. (Steaming has been used to develop egg quality in advance as part of fertility preparation).&nbsp;</li> <EOL></ul> <EOL> <EOL><p><strong>NOTES&nbsp; on Contraindications:</strong></p> <EOL> <EOL><p>The contraindication for infection is about the presence of a) fever or b) open wounds which will get worse with damp and steam.&nbsp;</p> <EOL> <EOL><ol> <EOL>\t<li>A) FEVER: If someone has a fever due to an infection, (gyne infection or otherwise) steaming is contraindicated, but you will often see hot baths or showers recommended for certain types of fever but not for others. With diagnosis, a practitioner can look at what the nature of the cause of the fever is and if warmth and steam will help to resolve it and release the exterior, or if it will exacerbate heat and fever.&nbsp; If you are unsure, or if the fever is going to get worse from a steam, then you can&nbsp; consider if using the herbal decoction as a douche would be appropriate. You may also decide to wait until the fever has resolved. The applicator syringe is 60ml with a catheter tip which is great for douche insertion and you can use less water than you would to create the douche decoction as for a steam decoction. Amounts and temperature guides are given in the instructions.</li> <EOL>\t<li>B) OPEN WOUNDS: If someone has any open skin wounds that can get infected from the toes up to the waist then steaming can be a risk because you wrap the whole lower body in a sheet or blanket to keep the steam inside. Things like leg ulcers would be a direct risk with steaming. Again you can decide if a body temperature or slightly warmer douche might be appropriate. If there are open wounds on the upper half of the body that are not infected or ulcerated they will often be ok, as long as the steam blanket is wrapped from the toes to the waist.&nbsp;</li> <EOL></ol> <EOL> <EOL><p><strong>OPTIONS FOR EACH KIT &ndash;</strong> detailed instructions come with each kit.</p> <EOL> <EOL><p>Steam: 1 cup decocted and steamed as warm as is comfortable to sit in for 20 minutes wrapped in a blanket.&nbsp;</p> <EOL> <EOL><p>Douche: &frac12;&nbsp; cup decocted (or use the decoction from a steam session) and applied at body temperature or a bit warmer for cold gyne patterns. 97 &ndash; 102F / 36- 39C</p> <EOL> <EOL><p>Enema: &frac12;&nbsp; cup decocted and applied at body temperature or a bit warmer for cold large intestine patterns. 97 &ndash; 102F / 36- 39C.</p> <EOL> <EOL><p>Male genital soak: &frac12;&nbsp; cup decocted and cooled to below body temperature, around room temperature 75-85F&nbsp; or 23C -30C then used as a soak.

She Chuang Zi dries dampness, kills worms, and stops itching; Bai Bu kills worms especially when applied externally; and Bo He clears heat and resolves the exterior, thus effusing wind evils depressed in the skin. Bing Pian (Borneol) is an aromatic substance which opens the orifices when taken internally. When used topically, it clears heat and resolves toxins as well as stops itching. However, it also thins or loosens the interstices so that the other medicinals can cross the barrier of the skin more easily. Ming Fan is an alternate name for Bai Fan (Alumen) or Ku Fan and comes from the category of substances specifically for topical application. It resolves toxins and dries dampness, kills worms and stops itching. It is particularly effective for itching when combined with Bai Bu and with She Chuang Zi. Ming Fan is an important ingredient in the practice of Chinese medical dermatology. Method of Use Apply to a small area first in order to assess each individuals reaction. Peoples skin is highly variable in its reaction. As long as there are no side or unwanted effects, apply to larger areas as necessary.</p> <EOL>",

The Chinese herbs in this formula have been used to promote lip health and beauty for over 1,000 years.</p> <EOL> <EOL><p>The addition of superior botanical oils and synergistic essential oils puts this product light years ahead of most lip balms. This is not a frivols cosmetic one might use to smell good and look good. It does provide both of those benefits. However, this medicinal cosmetic is designed to deliver some real therapeutic assistance to the lips.</p> <EOL> <EOL><p>The intent of this herbal formula is the protection and maintenance of healthy tissue of this exposed skin. The lips do not have sweat glands. So, they are naturally more prone to dryness and are also less protected from external invasions. The herbs in this formula bring much needed help to the lips in their unending work of interacting with the outside environment.</p> <EOL> <EOL><p>Some specific actions of these herbs are:</p> <EOL> <EOL><ol> <EOL>\t<li> <EOL>\t<div style=\"BORDER-TOP-COLOR: ; BORDER-LEFT-COLOR: ; BORDER-BOTTOM-COLOR: ; BORDER-RIGHT-COLOR: \">The expelling of toxins and the support for the circulation and moving of energy and fluids.

The overall effect is to help maintain homeostasis or the &quot;Goldie Locks&quot; zone of just right, not too hot and not too cold.</div> <EOL>\t</li> <EOL></ol> <EOL> <EOL><p>The powerhouse formulation of botanical oils in this formula is quite unique in a lip balm. Some of the oils are particularly effective as carrier oils that can reportedly penetrate more easily into the skin, thus carrying the nutrients and the beneficial compounds of the essential oils and herbs into the deeper tissue of the lips. Some of the oils and waxes are protective and sealing in nature. These oils are not overly greasy. The balance between absorption and surface protection is &quot;just right&quot;.</p> <EOL> <EOL><p>One aspect of this amazing product is the fragrant herbs that &quot;move qi&quot; or circulate energy and fluids. This herbal fragrance is subtly apparent, underscoring the light floral aroma of the essential oils. Jatamansi or Indian Valerian root has a sweet smell that holds the other aromas together. Jatamansi is also a heavyweight of an essential oil. In the East it is well known to impart incredible healing benefits internally and topically when applied to the skin. The other more common essential oils are no lightweights when it comes to promoting healthy skin. In addition to their general ?healing? abilities they are also known to protect against infections and invasion of external pathogens.</p> <EOL>",

For each case it is best to consult a post partum steam trained practitioner as it depends on diagnosis).&nbsp;</li> <EOL>\t<li>After ovulation while trying to conceive. (Steaming has been used to develop egg quality in advance as part of fertility preparation).&nbsp;</li> <EOL></ul> <EOL> <EOL><p><strong>NOTES&nbsp; on Contraindications:</strong></p> <EOL> <EOL><p>The contraindication for infection is about the presence of a) fever or b) open wounds which will get worse with damp and steam.&nbsp;</p> <EOL> <EOL><ol> <EOL>\t<li>A) FEVER: If someone has a fever due to an infection, (gyne infection or otherwise) steaming is contraindicated, but you will often see hot baths or showers recommended for certain types of fever but not for others. With diagnosis, a practitioner can look at what the nature of the cause of the fever is and if warmth and steam will help to resolve it and release the exterior, or if it will exacerbate heat and fever.&nbsp; If you are unsure, or if the fever is going to get worse from a steam, then you can&nbsp; consider if using the herbal decoction as a douche would be appropriate. You may also decide to wait until the fever has resolved. The applicator syringe is 60ml with a catheter tip which is great for douche insertion and you can use less water than you would to create the douche decoction as for a steam decoction. Amounts and temperature guides are given in the instructions.</li> <EOL>\t<li>B) OPEN WOUNDS: If someone has any open skin wounds that can get infected from the toes up to the waist then steaming can be a risk because you wrap the whole lower body in a sheet or blanket to keep the steam inside. Things like leg ulcers would be a direct risk with steaming. Again you can decide if a body temperature or slightly warmer douche might be appropriate. If there are open wounds on the upper half of the body that are not infected or ulcerated they will often be ok, as long as the steam blanket is wrapped from the toes to the waist.&nbsp;</li> <EOL></ol> <EOL> <EOL><p><strong>OPTIONS FOR EACH KIT &ndash;</strong> detailed instructions come with each kit.</p> <EOL> <EOL><p>Steam: 1 cup decocted and steamed as warm as is comfortable to sit in for 20 minutes wrapped in a blanket.&nbsp;</p> <EOL> <EOL><p>Douche: &frac12;&nbsp; cup decocted (or use the decoction from a steam session) and applied at body temperature or a bit warmer for cold gyne patterns. 97 &ndash; 102F / 36- 39C</p> <EOL> <EOL><p>Enema: &frac12;&nbsp; cup decocted and applied at body temperature or a bit warmer for cold large intestine patterns. 97 &ndash; 102F / 36- 39C.</p> <EOL> <EOL><p>Male genital soak: &frac12;&nbsp; cup decocted and cooled to below body temperature, around room temperature 75-85F&nbsp; or 23C -30C then used as a soak.

In the early 1900&#39;s, Kwok Chu-nam, an expert in Chinese medicine, developed a medicated oil for external use with a blend of Chinese medicinal herbs. He named it Po Sum On, &quot;Protect the Heart&quot; Medicated Oil. As the story goes, friends and relatives were given this new product to try. When its effects were further proven, the product was officially marketed in Hong Kong and, from there, throughout East Asia. With a proven healing power for all sorts of complaints and supported by word-of-mouth, Po Sum On eventually became a household name in the Far East. Now this oil is available in an American version. It is still made with the same high quality ingredients but according to Western standards of manufacturing and packaging at a significantly lower price.</p> <EOL>",

It seems appropriate that face lifting has similar conditions and shares similar needs as those for treating stretch marks.</p> <EOL> <EOL><p>The formula notes that Bob Flaws left created the core herbal inspiration for our Golden Goddess Facial Gua Sha Oil:</p> <EOL> <EOL><p><em>In Chinese medicine, the net like structure of the skin is referred to as cou li or interstices... the interstices can either be shut and dense (bi mi) or scattered and relaxed (Shu Song). The coarsening and lack of tone of the skin due to aging is a process of the slackening of the interstices coupled with the lack of nourishment and moistening.<br /> <EOL>While the root disease mechanism of stretch marks is qi vacuity, once stretch marks have occurred, this qi vacuity is complicated by blood stasis in the network vessels locally. Therefore, within this formula, Huang Qi and Ren Shen strongly supplement the original qi, while Zhen Zhu clears heat, promotes healing, and engenders flesh when applied externally. ...research in China has shown that the external application of both Huang Qi and Ren Shen can promote healing of the skin...</em></p> <EOL>",

Jin Si Gao&rsquo;s herbal formula contains 16 active herbs which were carefully chosen to work together holistically and synergistically. Some create the primary healing functions; some increase the action of the primary herbs, and some decrease adverse reactions from the primary and secondary herbs. This formula is developed basing on the fact that effects are interdependent. Inflammation, for example, increases pain and gets in the way of healing, so herbs which reduce inflammation also tend to reduce pain and promote healing. Swelling and bruising are caused by accumulations of fluid, so herbs which increase blood flow also reduce bruising and swelling.

      "DETAILED_DESCRIPTION": "<p><strong>Medi-Pearl DermatoloQi Treatment for DRY SKIN with Pimples and Blackheads</strong></p> <EOL> <EOL><p>The Dry Skin Treatment is not just for those with pimples and blackheads, but for people with dry skin or who want an anti-aging treatment. Getting the mix right for dry skin with oily blockages is tricky, as often dryness can be the cause of oil imbalances.</p> <EOL> <EOL><p>Our unique blend of 8 Chinese herbs and preparation methods provide the ultimate treatment to promote skin healing as well as re-texturization of comedones so they come out easily and new blemishes cease to form. Featuring Astragalosides which can lengthen telomeres, potentiated with other skin nourishing herbs like Ji Xue Cao and Dang Gui this treatment is also anti-aging. Over about 6 weeks, this is an approximate guide of what you can expect for your skin:</p> <EOL> <EOL><p>Week 1-2: Blackheads start to easily come out as they re-texturize, pimples heal fast. Dry flakes and blemishes seem to heal more rapidly and new softer skin begins to come through underneath. Dry rough skin is becoming soft and plump.</p> <EOL> <EOL><p>Weeks 3-4: Depending on how many blemishes or blackheads you had to begin with, the prior stage may continue, but you&rsquo;ll find that less new blemishes form. The pores are staying cleaner. Dryness is becoming moisturized from deeper within the skin and lines and wrinkles appear reduced.</p> <EOL> <EOL><p>Weeks 5-6: Dryness, blemishes, tendency for pore blockages, fine lines and wrinkles have all reduced.</p> <EOL> <EOL><p>If your skin continues to form new pimples the cause is most likely an imbalance in your endocrine (hormonal) system or you are having reactions to foods, allergens or toxins in your environment. Please see a qualified practitioner for a customized care plan that is tailored to your unique health needs.</p> <EOL> <EOL><p><strong>DIRECTIONS: Suitable for use in Acupuncture treatments. See our facial &nbsp;acupuncture sequences with Bio HerboloQi products on our wholesale site for practitioners.&nbsp;</strong></p> <EOL> <EOL><p>EXTERNAL USE ONLY &ndash; SHAKE VERY WELL BEFORE USE &ndash; Contents settle. We prefer not to use harsh chemicals and the natural contents will settle. You do need to shake or stir well EACH TIME you use this product.</p> <EOL> <EOL><p>Use 2-3 times per week for 6 weeks. Continue use as needed. You may find you can use it less often for maintenance after the first 6 week course.</p> <EOL> <EOL><p>APPLY &ndash; Gua Sha or massage about 1 teaspoon of treatment into the skin and pores lightly for approximately 5-10 minutes. Then let the treatment soak into your skin for approximately 30 minutes. (Do not gua sha over cystic acne).</p> <EOL> <EOL><p>STEAM &ndash; Drape a warm wet washcloth over your face (or area of application) to steam for 1 minute before wiping the treatment off. You will need to repeat this step 3-4 times. You can extend the steam time to about 10 minutes, which will assist more stubborn blackheads to loosen for removal.</p> <EOL> <EOL><p>REMOVE &ndash; Using the warm wet washcloth wipe the treatment off a 3-4 times. Apply fresh warm water to the cloth each time you steam, then wipe. Don&rsquo;t use soaps to remove all of the treatment or you will lose a lot of the moisturization benefits that occur in the hours after removing this treatment.</p> <EOL> <EOL><p>TONE &ndash; You can use our Balancing Skin Toner to complete removal of the treatment and encourage pores to close.</p> <EOL> <EOL><p>MOISTURIZE &ndash; For best results apply our Amethyst Hyaluronic first, then our Non Linear Serum Moisturizer after removing your treatment or showering. Do not skip this step or it can work against our treatment&rsquo;s process. While the treatment is moisturizing, it is not a moisturizer. When you apply moisturizer you continue the process for the active ingredients on your face to be carried further into your skin cells. You will find the final step leaves your skin smoother and more hydrated from within.&nbsp;</p> <EOL> <EOL><p>Note: The first two applications of a Medi Pearl treatment may be more drying than the following applications as your skins oil balance restores.</p> <EOL> <EOL><p>If you have combination skin YES you can combine use of the DRY and OILY skin treatments. You can use each one on different skin areas, or blend them if you think you need a bit of each. For example, if you have an oily T Zone and dry cheeks, we recommend using the Dry treatment on the cheeks and the Oily treatment on the T Zone.&nbsp; If you have combination skin with no blemishes and want the anti-aging benefits we recommend using the DRY treatment.</p> <EOL> <EOL><p><em><strong>These&nbsp;statements&nbsp;have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration.

      "DETAILED_DESCRIPTION": "<p><strong>Medi-Pearl DermatoloQi Treatment for DRY SKIN with Pimples and Blackheads</strong></p> <EOL> <EOL><p>The Dry Skin Treatment is not just for those with pimples and blackheads, but for people with dry skin or who want an anti-aging treatment. Getting the mix right for dry skin with oily blockages is tricky, as often dryness can be the cause of oil imbalances.</p> <EOL> <EOL><p>Our unique blend of 8 Chinese herbs and preparation methods provide the ultimate treatment to promote skin healing as well as re-texturization of comedones so they come out easily and new blemishes cease to form. Featuring Astragalosides which can lengthen telomeres, potentiated with other skin nourishing herbs like Ji Xue Cao and Dang Gui this treatment is also anti-aging. Over about 6 weeks, this is an approximate guide of what you can expect for your skin:</p> <EOL> <EOL><p>Week 1-2: Blackheads start to easily come out as they re-texturize, pimples heal fast. Dry flakes and blemishes seem to heal more rapidly and new softer skin begins to come through underneath. Dry rough skin is becoming soft and plump.</p> <EOL> <EOL><p>Weeks 3-4: Depending on how many blemishes or blackheads you had to begin with, the prior stage may continue, but you&rsquo;ll find that less new blemishes form. The pores are staying cleaner. Dryness is becoming moisturized from deeper within the skin and lines and wrinkles appear reduced.</p> <EOL> <EOL><p>Weeks 5-6: Dryness, blemishes, tendency for pore blockages, fine lines and wrinkles have all reduced.</p> <EOL> <EOL><p>If your skin continues to form new pimples the cause is most likely an imbalance in your endocrine (hormonal) system or you are having reactions to foods, allergens or toxins in your environment. Please see a qualified practitioner for a customized care plan that is tailored to your unique health needs.</p> <EOL> <EOL><p><strong>DIRECTIONS: Suitable for use in Acupuncture treatments. See our facial &nbsp;acupuncture sequences with Bio HerboloQi products on our wholesale site for practitioners.&nbsp;</strong></p> <EOL> <EOL><p>EXTERNAL USE ONLY &ndash; SHAKE VERY WELL BEFORE USE &ndash; Contents settle. We prefer not to use harsh chemicals and the natural contents will settle. You do need to shake or stir well EACH TIME you use this product.</p> <EOL> <EOL><p>Use 2-3 times per week for 6 weeks. Continue use as needed. You may find you can use it less often for maintenance after the first 6 week course.</p> <EOL> <EOL><p>APPLY &ndash; Gua Sha or massage about 1 teaspoon of treatment into the skin and pores lightly for approximately 5-10 minutes. Then let the treatment soak into your skin for approximately 30 minutes. (Do not gua sha over cystic acne).</p> <EOL> <EOL><p>STEAM &ndash; Drape a warm wet washcloth over your face (or area of application) to steam for 1 minute before wiping the treatment off. You will need to repeat this step 3-4 times. You can extend the steam time to about 10 minutes, which will assist more stubborn blackheads to loosen for removal.</p> <EOL> <EOL><p>REMOVE &ndash; Using the warm wet washcloth wipe the treatment off a 3-4 times. Apply fresh warm water to the cloth each time you steam, then wipe. Don&rsquo;t use soaps to remove all of the treatment or you will lose a lot of the moisturization benefits that occur in the hours after removing this treatment.</p> <EOL> <EOL><p>TONE &ndash; You can use our Balancing Skin Toner to complete removal of the treatment and encourage pores to close.</p> <EOL> <EOL><p>MOISTURIZE &ndash; For best results apply our Amethyst Hyaluronic first, then our Non Linear Serum Moisturizer after removing your treatment or showering. Do not skip this step or it can work against our treatment&rsquo;s process. While the treatment is moisturizing, it is not a moisturizer. When you apply moisturizer you continue the process for the active ingredients on your face to be carried further into your skin cells. You will find the final step leaves your skin smoother and more hydrated from within.&nbsp;</p> <EOL> <EOL><p>Note: The first two applications of a Medi Pearl treatment may be more drying than the following applications as your skins oil balance restores.</p> <EOL> <EOL><p>If you have combination skin YES you can combine use of the DRY and OILY skin treatments. You can use each one on different skin areas, or blend them if you think you need a bit of each. For example, if you have an oily T Zone and dry cheeks, we recommend using the Dry treatment on the cheeks and the Oily treatment on the T Zone.&nbsp; If you have combination skin with no blemishes and want the anti-aging benefits we recommend using the DRY treatment.</p> <EOL> <EOL><p><em><strong>These&nbsp;statements&nbsp;have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration.

      "DETAILED_DESCRIPTION": "Our Mullein Garlic Ear Oil formula provides a natural means for addressing ear pain and infection. The key ingredient, Mullein Flowers, has been known to be a gentle yet effective herbal remedy for centuries. Dioscorides recommended the plant some 2000 years ago, and stories have been passed down of the Egyptians harvesting the plant along the banks of the Nile River. <EOL> <EOL>Mullein flowers have demonstrated antiviral actions as well as being successful in reducing inflammation, softening earwax, stimulating circulation in the ear, and acting as an anodyne to auditory nerves easing irritation and pain in the ear. We combine this remarkable flower with the antimicrobial power of fresh garlic. We extract the medicinal properties of these herbs with organic extra virgin olive oil and add natural vitamin E oil. The combination of these ingredients allow for a wide spectrum of ear problems to be addressed. It may also be used as a preventative for infants, children, or adults prone to chronic ear infections. The oil is a great accompaniment to ear candling. Use of the oil prior to candling softens earwax making the candles more effective. Furthermore, the oil can also be used topically on fungal infections of the skin and ring worm. Our ear oil is gentle enough to be used on children and animals. The sporadic flowering of the mullein plant, the high volume of flowers needed to produce the oil, and the integrity of our solarized extraction make for a tedious and lengthy manufacturing process. These steps, however, are necessary to ensure the product's widely recognized effectiveness.",

Initially there was a demand for a topical cream for people who are diabetic or taking medication that excluded them from enjoying the benefits of Nectar Ease. The actual market is much wider. Nectar Balm meets the needs of sports people and those in active occupations that make demands on the muscles, joints and ligaments. It is widely used by people who have very localized arthritic pain and those who occasionally experience &quot;break through&quot; pain, a common occurrence with many arthritic patients. It is a product that should be in everybodys medicine cabinets.* The top quality cream will not dry the skin but rather keeps it moist and acts like a deep heat. A little goes a long way making Nectar Balm a very economical and pleasant way to ease pain.* Whether its a pulled a muscle, tendonitis, repetitive strain injury, or you have overdone it at the gym, on the dance floor or in the garden; or they just ache from a bad nights sleep - reach for Nectar Balm - a bee venom and Manuka honey cream that delivers fast and effective relief.* A 100g pot of Nectar Balm is a must have balm and an essential part of any first-aid kit. The cream is soft and smooth in texture and is easily absorbed: a welcome benefit when massaging tender areas swollen due to sprains, strains, bruising or aching and stiff because of arthritis. Remarkably, it can also relieve the pain of a headache, when applied to the temples or the back of the neck!*</p> <EOL>",

This exciting new technology employs a piezoelectric ingredient that, when activated by body heat, emits a therapeutic Far Infrared frequency. This helps open the pores and aides in transporting the therapeutic herbal formulation into the affected tissue. For increased potency, the cream may be applied first allowing sufficient time for it to absorb into the skin, then apply the patch. This increases the number and amount of therapeutic herbs being applied and the patch stabilizes them on the affected area for a longer period of time.",
