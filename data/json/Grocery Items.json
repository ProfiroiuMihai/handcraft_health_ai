Organic Applewood Smoked Seasoned Celtic Sea Salt<sup>&reg;</sup> Blend brings the taste of outdoor cooking to any dish!</div> <EOL> <EOL><h3>Is Celtic Sea Salt&reg; Brand Salt Organic?</h3> <EOL> <EOL><p>In the United States, there is no organic certification for salt...yet. Currently, the USDA classifies salt as only a mineral. However, other countries have certifications for organic sea salts, such as <em>Nature et Progr&eacute;s</em> in France. <img src=\"https://cdn2.bigcommerce.com/server900/d113esj/product_images/uploaded_images/natureetprogres-icon.gif?t=1398725710\" style=\"float:left; margin-bottom:20px; margin-right:20px\" /></p> <EOL> <EOL><p><strong>Nature et Progr&eacute;s Certification - France</strong> France&#39;s certification is awarded to harvested and processed salt according to organic methods and standards. Nature et Progr&eacute;s is the highest and most stringent level of certification allowed. The quality chart guarantees full traceability, including the origin. The producer is identified and regularly controlled by the independent certifying body. The salt is unrefined and all natural, and is harvested in a protected, non-polluted environment. The salt beds are located a minimum of 500m away from main roads and are free from pesticides, chemical residue, industrial fumes or air pollution. Respect of product quality from harvest to final packaging is of utmost importance. The salt harvesters use only untreated wooden or polyethylene tools. It is mandatory that there is protection between the ground and the salt, and the salt must be harvested with non-polluting equipment. Celtic Sea Salt&reg; is certified organic by Nature et Progr&eacute;s - the highest level of certification allowed.</p> <EOL>",

It is useful for preventing diabetic retinopathy as well as treating night blindness, macular degeneration and cataracts. Blueberry concentrate is also beneficial for strengthening all other capillaries, arteries and veins. It can also be used for reducing capillary fragility and permeability in conditions such as varicose veins. An antioxidant/anti-inflammatory, it reduces free radical- caused inflammation and histamine release (allergies). Recent studies in animals have shown that as little as 1/2 cup of Blueberries per day can reduce symptoms of aging (memory loss, cognitive and motor impairment) and may help to prevent cancer, heart disease and arthralgias. Blueberries, like other Vaccinium species (Bilberry, Huckleberry, Cranberry) contain flavonoids such as anthocyanins which are potent antioxidants. Blueberries had the highest antioxidant capacity of 40 fruits and vegetables tested by the USDA. These berries have a powerful ability to protect against free radical damage, inhibit enzymes which may promote cancer, reduce histamine production and act as an anti-inflammatory nutrient to connective tissue.",

It is home to the Yi, which is thinking and concentration. This energy is responsible for distributing Qi throughout the body, aiding in mental focus, intention, and determination. We invoke the Yellow Snake here because it represents the stabilizing forces of the earth, the center, and the sun, and offers a supportive life-force.

      "WESTERN_SYMPTOMOLOGY": "Supports cardiovascular health.  ******  Hawthorn has been traditionally used in Europe in to treat hypertension, coronary artery disease, angina and hypercholesteremia. Recent research has shown that a diet rich in polyphenols decreases cardiovascular risk by inhibiting low density lipoprotein (LDL) oxidation, which is a primary event in atherosclerosis plaque formation1. Clinical trials using hawthorn in patients with and without prescription hypotensive agents showed a marked decrease in blood pressure as well as a decrease in clinical symptoms of fatigue, dyspnea and lack of vitality2,3,4. Hawthorn is also beneficial to patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction and laboratory studies suggest that this may be due to improvement in the contractility of impaired myocardium5. A review of 9 different clinical trials designed to study the effect of hawthorn in patients with congestive heart failure concluded that â€œCrataegus is an effective and safe treatment for this indicationâ€6,7. The positive effect of hawthorn on a wide range of cardiac and circulatory conditions demonstrates the ability of this medicinal fruit to deliver plaque-fighting capabilities and improve cardiac tonicity. While many products increase blood circulation by elevating blood pressure, hawthorn is unique in that it increases circulation and simultaneously lowers blood pressure. Hawthorn fruit contains oligomeric procyanidins (OPCâ€™s), which are a class of nutrients in the polyphenol family. The berries also contain rutin (a flavonoid) and triterpene acids such as Vitexin, Crateagolic acid, Vitexin-O-Rhamnoside and Isovitexin. OPCâ€™s and other flavonoids help inhibit angiotensin-converting enzymes, causing vasodilation and hence, improve circulation and blood vessel integrity6. The antioxidants in hawthorn prevent further deterioration and reduce inflammation. Rutin and other flavonoids are thought to rebuild the collagen fibers in the outer layers of the blood vessels, which also strengthens them8. Hawthorn is also used to lower serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels.9",

      "WESTERN_SYMPTOMOLOGY": "Supports cardiovascular health.  ******  Hawthorn has been traditionally used in Europe in to treat hypertension, coronary artery disease, angina and hypercholesteremia. Recent research has shown that a diet rich in polyphenols decreases cardiovascular risk by inhibiting low density lipoprotein (LDL) oxidation, which is a primary event in atherosclerosis plaque formation1. Clinical trials using hawthorn in patients with and without prescription hypotensive agents showed a marked decrease in blood pressure as well as a decrease in clinical symptoms of fatigue, dyspnea and lack of vitality2,3,4. Hawthorn is also beneficial to patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction and laboratory studies suggest that this may be due to improvement in the contractility of impaired myocardium5. A review of 9 different clinical trials designed to study the effect of hawthorn in patients with congestive heart failure concluded that â€œCrataegus is an effective and safe treatment for this indicationâ€6,7. The positive effect of hawthorn on a wide range of cardiac and circulatory conditions demonstrates the ability of this medicinal fruit to deliver plaque-fighting capabilities and improve cardiac tonicity. While many products increase blood circulation by elevating blood pressure, hawthorn is unique in that it increases circulation and simultaneously lowers blood pressure. Hawthorn fruit contains oligomeric procyanidins (OPCâ€™s), which are a class of nutrients in the polyphenol family. The berries also contain rutin (a flavonoid) and triterpene acids such as Vitexin, Crateagolic acid, Vitexin-O-Rhamnoside and Isovitexin. OPCâ€™s and other flavonoids help inhibit angiotensin-converting enzymes, causing vasodilation and hence, improve circulation and blood vessel integrity6.

The producer is identified and regularly controlled by the independent certifying body. The salt is unrefined and all natural, and is harvested in a protected, non-polluted environment. The salt beds are located a minimum of 500m away from main roads and are free from pesticides, chemical residue, industrial fumes or air pollution. Respect of product quality from harvest to final packaging is of utmost importance. The salt harvesters use only untreated wooden or polyethylene tools. It is mandatory that there is protection between the ground and the salt, and the salt must be harvested with non-polluting equipment.

      "DETAILED_DESCRIPTION": "<p>Our liquid soap&hellip;. Wait until you see and try our Organic Liquid Soap Soother. It is unlike any liquid soap you have ever seen. Like all of the Emily products, it is made for people with sensitive skin and for people who are careful about what they put on their skin. It is organic certified, has no color, no fragrance, and is made with gentle, all-natural ingredients.</p> <EOL> <EOL><p>Then it is &ldquo;super-fatted&rdquo;. &lsquo;What does that mean?&rsquo; you ask. Read on and we&rsquo;ll explain...</p> <EOL> <EOL><p>We start with the gentlest organic soap/gel base made of rich, moistening and organic ingredients that will not strip your protective oils or make your skin drier:</p> <EOL> <EOL><ul> <EOL>\t<li>&bull; Saponified Organic Coconut Oil</li> <EOL>\t<li>&bull; Saponified Organic Olive Oil</li> <EOL>\t<li>&bull; Saponified Organic Jojoba Oil</li> <EOL>\t<li>&bull; Organic Guar Gum Extract</li> <EOL>\t<li>&bull; Organic Aloe Vera</li> <EOL>\t<li>&bull; Rosemary Extract</li> <EOL></ul> <EOL> <EOL><p>There is absolutely nothing else in our soap base. NO parabens. NO Sodium Laurel or Laureth Sulfate (SLS). NO added color. NO added fragrances.</p> <EOL> <EOL><p>Then we take more Organic Olive Oil and cook in the following 4 herbs:</p> <EOL> <EOL><ul> <EOL>\t<li>&bull; Rehmannia Root</li> <EOL>\t<li>&bull; Angelica Sinensis Root</li> <EOL>\t<li>&bull; Dandelion Herb</li> <EOL>\t<li>&bull; Field Mint</li> <EOL></ul> <EOL> <EOL><p>This herb-infused oil is then added back to our soap base. In traditional soap making, adding extra oils back into soap is called &ldquo;super-fatting&rdquo;. It makes for an extra moistening, silky and emollient soap. &nbsp;</p> <EOL> <EOL><p>We do not know of any other &lsquo;super-fatted&rsquo; liquid soap available. It simply is more expensive to make and most manufacturers are afraid that customers will be scared off by a product that settles.&nbsp;</p> <EOL> <EOL><p>We are just the opposite. We&rsquo;ve put it in a clear bottle so you can see that &lsquo;super-fatted&rsquo; difference. If you let it sit for a while, those extra oils will settle. As it says on the label, &ldquo;This is a natural product. If it settles, shake it! Shake it! Shake it!&rdquo; &nbsp;</p> <EOL> <EOL><p>We are confident that you have never seen or felt a liquid soap this gentle and soothing.</p> <EOL> <EOL><p>Our Liquid Soap Soother lathers wonderfully but does not strip or dry your skin. Use it from head to toe, for all your soap needs.</p> <EOL> <EOL><p>For people with dry skin conditions, soaps can be a huge factor. Most commercial soaps are TROUBLE. They smell and lather well, but they are full of harsh chemicals and fragrances which open your pores up and strip away your natural, protective oils, leaving you drier. Even soaps that are supposedly for &lsquo;sensitive skin&rsquo; or for &lsquo;infants&rsquo; are often full of harsh chemicals, just in smaller amounts. Emily and I both have sensitive skin and liquid soaps were almost impossible for us. That is why we had to make a healthy alternative.</p> <EOL> <EOL><p>If you have dry or sensitive skin you should use a natural soap with as few ingredients as possible. The more ingredients, the more your skin has to deal with and potentially react to. Read your labels to see how many unpronounceable ingredients are in most soap. Then, try our soap. We think you&rsquo;ll find it leaves your skin clean, soft, and happy. Your skin will thank you.</p> <EOL>",

      "DETAILED_DESCRIPTION": "<p>Multiflora Honey is a distinctive blend of pure, GM Free honeys sourced from New Zealand&rsquo;s forests and pastures. Multiflora Honey is processed using state-of-the-art equipment and our world-renowned &ldquo;creamed&rdquo; honey process to create a honey with a beautifully smooth texture and superb spreadability. Honey contains life supporting vitamins and minerals, as well as occurring enzymes, which aid functions such as digestion, cell regeneration, tissue repair, bone maintenance, muscle activity and even our ability to think! The retention of natural goodness is vital, so this honey is cool-treated (raw) to ensure the honey stays rich in nutrients and full of flavor. This means that the valuable natural sugars in bio-available glucose and fructose form are also retained, providing slow release, sustained energy for hours. The consumption of honey is not suitable for children under one year old.</p> <EOL>",

It quickly clears the air, leaving only fresh air behind.</p> <EOL> <EOL><p><strong>The&nbsp;<em>Odor Off&nbsp;</em>&nbsp;Story</strong></p> <EOL> <EOL><p>The original version of&nbsp;<em>Odor Off</em>&nbsp;was developed by an ecological farmer to prevent the smell from manure in his barnyard, and the flies that smell attracts.&nbsp;<em>Odor Off</em>&nbsp;is the home version of that formula, prepared homeopathically from natural, plant-based ingredients.&nbsp;One of the first non-medicinal uses of homeopathy,&nbsp;<em>Odor Off</em>&nbsp;took 16 years to develop. It is safe for humans, pets, and the environment. Unscented formulation lasts for months.</p> <EOL> <EOL><p>&nbsp;</p> <EOL> <EOL><h2>Customer Testimonials</h2> <EOL> <EOL><p>&quot;My rabbit shares my house with me, and uses his litter box faithfully - however, bunny urine is very potent and has a strong ammonia smell. When the heat is on in the house the smell from his litter-box can become quite over-powering, no matter how frequently it is changed. I have avoided using anything in his litter-box to help curb the smell because rabbits have a very sensitive respiratory system. I felt safe trying the Odor-Off because it is homeopathic and does not work by filling the air with strong aromatic oils or chemicals. I sprayed the urine and pellet area and waited about a minute, then gave it the &#39;sniff test&#39;. I have to admit to being surprised....it no longer had any odor. Since that little experiment I have used Odor-Off consistently in his litter-box and the bathroom (which is a much nicer place now too!) Thank you for a remarkable, effective and safe product that doesn&#39;t do what all other products do, i.e. integrate another smell with a nasty one, and create an even worse one! With Odor-Off smells just disappear.&quot; -G.M.S&nbsp;</p> <EOL> <EOL><p>&quot;This odor eliminator is exceptionally good! For those of us who wish to avoid scented air fresheners, Odor Off gives us the way to get rid of unwanted odors. Instead of masking them, this product just eliminates them. It knocks off odors with a (gentle) bang. I use it in my cat litter boxes to decrease odor in between cleanings - works like a charm. The litter boxes definitely stay fresher longer. I also have a large iguana whose cedar litter can get overwhelming at times. Odor Off takes care of that unwanted smell also -- not to mention its use in bathrooms also. Odor Off is remarkable, it works on odors in the air as well as on odor-producing materials.&quot;Jennifer L.</p> <EOL> <EOL><p>&quot;My 12-year-old van was in an accident a few years ago and the back door leaked for a few months before it was finally fixed. The rug under the leak became full of mildew, and the smell filled the van when the back seat was up and exposed the rug. I had stopped using the back seat because of the smell. I used just a few sprays of Odor Off a month ago and the smell is gone - and the seat has been up and available for use ever since!&quot; A.C.</p> <EOL>",

Pomegranateâ€™s ellagitannins inhibit gene expression of androgen-synthesizing hormones and nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB), both of which are involved in tumor cell growth of recurrent prostate cancer 15, 16. This inhibition of angiogenesis may be useful as a chemopreventative or chemotherapeutic agent, especially when combined with conventional treatment 17.  ******  Lycium (Lycium barbarum) - Also known as goji berry or Gou Qi Zi, lycium is used in Traditional Chinese Medicine to nourish the Chinese liver and Chinese kidney which are involved with the functions of eyesight, growth, maturation and aging. It is protective to the Western liver and laboratory studies have shown that this may be achieved by the fruitâ€™s ability to stimulate T lymphocyte activation 21. Laboratory studies have demonstrated that the polysaccharides found in lycium reduce the risk of lipid peroxidation accelerated by age-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) and increase total antioxidant capacity (TOAC) and immune function, both of which decline with age and/or disease 4. These same polysaccharides protect muscle fibers in the heart and skeletal muscle by increasing creatine kinase levels 5, 6 and attenuating beta-amyloid (Abeta) toxicity in neurons, which occurs at the onset of Alzheimerâ€™s disease 7-9. Human clinical trials showed that ingestion of lycium increased energy levels, mental acuity and reduced stress 14 .",

If it&rsquo;s your facial moisturizer, then there&rsquo;s the problem! The skin under your eyes is the thinnest and most delicate skin on the body. Therefore, it needs a product that is thicker, richer and specially formulated to take care of its very specific needs.

      "DETAILED_DESCRIPTION": "<p>This very special edition features the ancient symbol of the Flower of Life etched on the bottle and comes with a blend of the most popular crystals in VitaJuwel history: Amethyst, Aquamarine and Clear Quartz.</p> <EOL> <EOL><p>Throughout the ages, in ancient manuscripts and temple inscriptions there has always been one symbol in all cultures that stood for the harmony, balance and endless mystery of the universe: The Flower of Life. The oldest depiction (in the Temple of Osiris in Egypt) date back at least 6,000 years. Everything seen and unseen in nature and beyond is depicted by this forceful ornament of overlapping circles. The symbol has been studied by Leonardo da Vinci and dome say that the Flower of Life provides enlightenment to those who emerge themselves in the symbol and its perfect form.</p> <EOL> <EOL><p>We&rsquo;re honestly not sure which tradition is older: Using the positive vibrations of crystals to infuse water with energy or drawing a Flower of Life on a glass vessel to let its power work on the water. Either way, we&rsquo;re absolutely sure that both ways work and it has about become time that we combine those two elemental forces for the sake of good water.</p> <EOL> <EOL><p>This special edition features an extra-large Flower of Life symbol on the glass part of the bottle. Made by master glass artisans in Bohemia.</p> <EOL> <EOL><p>We carefully chose the crystal blend to complement this deeply spiritual symbol. Amethyst is the stone of the crown chakra. Incredibly protective, healing and purifying, it is said to bring forth humility, sincerity and inner wisdom. Aquamarine is used to clear the mind, calm the heart and quiet the mind. The perfect meditation stone. Together they act as powerful door openers for spiritual enlightenment and a higher consciousness.</p> <EOL> <EOL><table class=\"additional-attributes data table\" id=\"product-attribute-specs-table\"> <EOL>\t<tbody> <EOL>\t\t<tr> <EOL>\t\t\t<th scope=\"row\">Comes With</th> <EOL>\t\t\t<td>glass cylinder, lid, gempod</td> <EOL>\t\t</tr> <EOL>\t\t<tr> <EOL>\t\t\t<th scope=\"row\">Dimensions &amp; Weight</th> <EOL>\t\t\t<td>diameter 6,7 cm., height 22,5cm, volume 500ml</td> <EOL>\t\t</tr> <EOL>\t\t<tr> <EOL>\t\t\t<th scope=\"row\">Material</th> <EOL>\t\t\t<td>borosilicate glass, gemstones, stainless steel, bpa-free plastic, silicone</td> <EOL>\t\t</tr> <EOL>\t\t<tr> <EOL>\t\t\t<th scope=\"row\">Care</th> <EOL>\t\t\t<td>glass cylinder dishwasher-proof, handwash lid and gempod, disassemble gempod before cleaning</td> <EOL>\t\t</tr> <EOL>\t</tbody> <EOL></table> <EOL>",

Numerous studies have been done on xylitol including WHO Hungary 1981-84, Ylivieska clinic studies 1982-85, Montreal 1985-86, and Belize 1989-93. These studies employed various modes of administration, such as gum, toothpaste, and confectionery. The subjects studied were of all different ages. In each of the cases, the same trend has been observed, demonstrating that xylitol significantly reduces the incidence of tooth decay when compared to controls who did not receive xylitol. The most recently conducted major study (Belize 1989-93) was also the first to directly compare the efficacy of xylitol and sorbitol gums. Children in the xylitol group showed a 70% lower risk than the &quot;no gum&quot; group and an almost 50% lower risk than those in the sorbitol group. Xylitol has shown itself as an extremely valuable tool in preventative dentistry.*</p> <EOL>",

Numerous studies have been done on xylitol including WHO Hungary 1981-84, Ylivieska clinic studies 1982-85, Montreal 1985-86, and Belize 1989-93. These studies employed various modes of administration, such as gum, toothpaste, and confectionery. The subjects studied were of all different ages. In each of the cases, the same trend has been observed, demonstrating that xylitol significantly reduces the incidence of tooth decay when compared to controls who did not receive xylitol. The most recently conducted major study (Belize 1989-93) was also the first to directly compare the efficacy of xylitol and sorbitol gums. Children in the xylitol group showed a 70% lower risk than the &ldquo;no gum&rdquo; group and an almost 50% lower risk than those in the sorbitol group. Xylitol has shown itself as an extremely valuable tool in preventative dentistry.*</p> <EOL>",
